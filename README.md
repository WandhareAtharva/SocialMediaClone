# Debugging APIs
Follow these steps if any API is not working for debugging purpose:
```
1. Check all necessary imports are present or not.

2. Use console.log() statements to ensure the data is actually present before performing any operation on it.

3. Check if the API endpoint is correct and the server is running.

4. Verify if the request headers and body are correctly set.

5. Look for any error messages in the console or network tab.

6. Ensure that the database is properly connected and the queries are correct.

7. If using third-party services, check their status and configurations.

8. Restart the server and try again.

9. If the issue persists, consult/seek help from me (Atharva).
